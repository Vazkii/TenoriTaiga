Tenori Taiga
======

A small anime index. (WIP)  

**How to use:**

1. Have a server with apache/nginx and php, drop this repo in there, either through git or just download it.
2. Configure to your liking in config.php.
3. Put your anime folders in the anime dir you selected. The folder name will be used to fetch the metadata, but in each folder you may include an "id" file with the Hummingbird ID of that anime if you find the auto assigner isn't correct.
4. Load up the index.php, you're done.
